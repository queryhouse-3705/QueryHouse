## Inconsistencies

> Note: Detailed descriptions of each inconsistency are currently being prepared.

| ID | DBMSs | Feature | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | All | Comparison between textual and numeric data | [ðŸ”—](./incon1.md) Some DBMSs allow implicit comparison between strings and numbers, others throw errors. |
| 2 | All | Rounding in `CAST AS INT` | <!-- [ðŸ”—](./incon2.md) --> Behavior of casting floats to integers varies: some truncate, others round. |
| 3 | All | Return type of division | <!-- [ðŸ”—](./incon3.md) --> Integer division returns different typesâ€”float or integerâ€”depending on the DBMS. |
| 4 | MySQL, MariaDB | `FULL JOIN`/`FULL OUTER JOIN` | <!-- [ðŸ”—](./incon4.md) --> MySQL does not support `FULL OUTER JOIN` natively unlike other DBMSs. |
| 5 | MySQL | Precision of `JSON DOUBLE` | <!-- [ðŸ”—](./incon5.md) --> `DOUBLE` values in JSON may lose precision when serialized or queried. |
| 6 | PostgreSQL, Oracle | Sorting `JSON` | <!-- [ðŸ”—](./incon6.md) --> Sorting behavior for `JSON` values varies and may raise errors or return unexpected order. |
| 7 | MySQL | `LENGTH` on `JSON` types | <!-- [ðŸ”—](./incon7.md) --> `LENGTH()` returns byte length of JSON text, not element count, unlike other DBMSs. |
| 8 | All | Index access on non-array `JSON` data types | <!-- [ðŸ”—](./incon8.md) --> Using numeric keys on non-array JSON types is accepted by some DBMSs, but not others. |
